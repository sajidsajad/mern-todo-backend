Backend API for a MERN-based Todo application

# üìö Mern Todo Backend Application (mern-todo-backend)

Backend API for a **MERN-based Todo application** built with **Node.js** and **Express**. It allows users to manage their tasks by **adding, editing, marking as completed, and deleting them.** The tasks are persisted in **MongoDB**, so they remain available even after page reloads or when accessed from different devices.

---

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Users can manage tasks with basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed, and completed tasks will be visually indicated with a strikethrough.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks based on completion status (All, Completed, or Pending).
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored in MongoDB and persist even after page reloads.
